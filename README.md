# Historian

**Description**: Stores document changes in a subcollection, alongside a timestamp and a deleteAfter field, so that in combination with Firestore TTL, you can automatically delete these changes documents after a chosen period of time.


**Details**: Use this extension to automatically store changes to your firestore collections in a separate subcollection. 

You can configure this extension with the subcollection name. The default subcollection is named historian.

You can configure this extension with the period of days the data will be stored. The default is 30 days. This requires configuration that this extension does not handle automatically: Setting the Firestore TTL to delete documents.

Data is typically deleted within 72 hours after its expiration date.
