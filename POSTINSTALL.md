# Using the extension

After installing the extension, you can update your Firestore documents as usual. The extension will automatically store the changes in a separate subcollection, determined when you install the extension.

# Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
